* `anthropic` Python package (required only for AI features)

---

## Installation

### Step 1 — Get the app

```bash
cd /path/to/frappe-bench
bench get-app real_estate https://github.com/Zaryab03/real_estate.git
```

### Step 2 — Install the Python AI client (optional but recommended)

```bash
./env/bin/pip install anthropic
```

### Step 3 — Install on your site

```bash
bench --site yoursite.com install-app real_estate
```

### Step 4 — Run migrations

```bash
bench --site yoursite.com migrate
```

This creates all 22 DocType tables, registers the 4 roles, creates ERPNext billing items, applies tenant custom fields on the Customer DocType, and creates the Real Estate workspace.

### Step 5 — Build frontend assets

```bash
bench build --app real_estate
```

### Step 6 — Restart the bench

```bash
# Production (supervisor)
sudo supervisorctl restart all

# Development
bench start
```

---

## Configuration

### Claude AI Key

Open `sites/yoursite.com/site_config.json` and add:

```json
{
  "real_estate_claude_api_key": "sk-ant-..."
}
```

Without this key the app works fully; AI feature buttons will show a friendly message asking to configure the key. Never commit this value to version control.

### Utility Meter Reading API

IoT devices and smart meters can push readings via the REST API:

```http
POST /api/method/real_estate.utils.meter_reading.receive_meter_reading
Authorization: token <api_key>:<api_secret>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "unit_name": "PROP001-U001",
  "utility_type": "Electricity",
  "reading": 12345.6,
  "reading_date": "2025-01-15"
}
```

The system finds the previous reading, calculates consumption, applies the matching slab rate from the Utility Rate Card, and updates the current open Rent Invoice automatically.

---

## Roles and Permissions

| Role | Desk Access | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| Property Manager | Yes | Full access to all doctypes, dashboards, settings |
| Real Estate Agent | Yes | Properties, units, listings, inquiries, lease creation |

## Module Guide

### Properties

**Property** is the top-level record representing a building, villa, or land parcel.

Fields to fill in:
* Property Name and Property Code (used for auto-naming units)
* Property Type: Residential, Commercial, Industrial, Mixed-Use, Land
* Owner: link to a Customer or Supplier record
* Address and Geo Coordinates (Geolocation field — paste lat,lng)
* Amenities (Table MultiSelect from a predefined list)
* Status: Available, Occupied, Under Maintenance, For Sale

Use the Documents child table to store contracts, title deeds, and NOCs with expiry dates. The daily scheduler will email Property Managers when any document is approaching its expiry.

**Property Unit** represents an individual rentable space inside a property.

Fields to fill in:
* Property (links to the parent Property)
* Unit Number and Unit Type (Studio, 1BHK, 2BHK, Office, Shop, Warehouse)
* Floor Area and Floor Number
* Monthly Rent (suggested by AI — see AI Features)
* Status: Available, Occupied, Reserved, Under Maintenance

The unit status is managed automatically. When a Lease Agreement is submitted the unit moves to Occupied. When the lease is cancelled or expires it returns to Available.

---

### Leasing

**Lease Agreement** is the core transactional document for tenant leasing.

How to create a lease:
1. Open a Property Unit and click **New Lease** from the quick buttons in the top right.
2. The unit, property, and monthly rent are pre-filled.
3. Set the Tenant (link to an ERPNext Customer), Start Date, and End Date.
4. Configure the Payment Due Day (1–28), Grace Period, and Late Fee Percent.
5. Optionally link an Agent and set the commission.
6. Click **Generate Clauses (AI)** to draft the standard tenancy clauses automatically.
7. Save, review, then Submit. The unit status changes to Occupied and a Security Deposit Ledger entry is created.

**Lease Renewal**

Click **Renew Lease** on a submitted Lease Agreement. A dialog asks for the new end date and whether to apply annual escalation. A new draft lease is created with the updated terms and the renewal is recorded in the Renewal History table.

**Lease Termination**

Click **Terminate Lease** on a submitted Lease Agreement. This cancels the agreement, marks the unit as Available, and initiates the security deposit refund workflow.

---

### Billing

**Rent Invoice** is created automatically by the daily scheduler on the configured Payment Due Day. It can also be created manually from the Lease Agreement form.

The invoice calculates:
* Base Rent (from the lease)
* Utility Charges (electricity, water, gas — from meter readings)
* Late Fee (applied after grace period)
* Discount (manual entry)
* VAT (configured percentage)
* Total Amount

When the invoice is submitted an ERPNext Sales Invoice is created and linked automatically.

**Utility Rate Cards**

Before using utility billing, create a Utility Rate Card for each utility type. Add slabs to define tiered pricing (e.g. first 100 units at 0.10 SAR, next 200 units at 0.15 SAR). Link the rate card to the Property Unit.

**Late Fees and Reminders**

The daily scheduler sends payment reminder emails at 3 days before due, on the due date, and 1 day after the grace period. After the grace period passes, a late fee is added and the invoice status moves to Overdue.

---

### Maintenance

**Maintenance Request** captures repair and service requests for any property unit.

How to raise a request:
1. From a Property Unit, click **New Maintenance Request**.
2. Set the Category (Plumbing, Electrical, HVAC, Civil, Cleaning, Other), Priority, and description.
3. Attach photos using the standard file attachment field.
4. Save — Property Managers are notified by email immediately. Emergency-priority requests also trigger a real-time browser notification.

The request moves through statuses: Open → Assigned → In Progress → Completed → Cancelled.

**Assign to Vendor**: Once a vendor is selected, click **Assign to Vendor** to record the vendor and expected completion date.

**Property Inspection**

Create an Inspection linked to a unit. Choose the Inspection Type:
* Move-In — documents the condition before a tenant moves in
* Move-Out — documents the condition when a tenant vacates
* Periodic — routine condition check
* Pre-Sale — condition assessment before listing for sale

The checklist is auto-populated with standard items for each inspection type. Rate each item and add remarks and photos.

---

### Sales

**Sale Agreement** records the sale of a property.

How to create a sale:
1. Open a Property and click **New Sale Agreement**.
2. Set the Buyer, Sale Price, and currency.
3. Add rows to the Payment Schedule table with milestone names, amounts, and due dates. The total must equal the Sale Price.
4. Optionally link an Agent and commission.
5. Submit when executed.

**Generate Milestone Invoices**: Click this button to create ERPNext Sales Invoices for all payment schedule milestones that are due today or earlier.

**Agent Management**

The Agent DocType stores agent profiles with commission rates. The Agent dashboard shows pending commission from all linked Lease and Sale Agreements. Use the **View Leases** and **View Sale Agreements** buttons on the Agent form to navigate to related records.

---

### Owner Statements

**Owner Statement** is a monthly financial summary for a property owner.

Statements are generated automatically each month by the scheduler for all active properties. You can also create one manually.

**Compute from Invoices**: Click this button to pull all paid Rent Invoices and completed Maintenance Requests for the statement period and populate the income and expense totals.

When submitted, the system:
1. Creates a Journal Entry crediting the owner's account
2. Generates a 2-paragraph AI narrative summarising portfolio performance for the month

The AI narrative appears in the **AI Summary** field and is included in the print output.

---

### Listings and Inquiries

**Property Listing** creates a public-facing record for an available unit. Set the listing price, highlights, and photos. The inquiry counter tracks how many visitors have expressed interest.

**Visitor Lead Inquiry** captures interest from prospective tenants or buyers submitted via the property listing page. On save:
* The parent listing's inquiry count increments
* A CRM Lead is created automatically in ERPNext

---

## AI Features

All AI features use Claude (`claude-sonnet-4-6`) via the Anthropic API. The API key must be set in `site_config.json` as `real_estate_claude_api_key`.

### Rent Valuation

On the Property Unit form, click **Suggest Rent (AI)**. A dialog appears with:
* Suggested minimum and maximum monthly rent
* Reasoning based on unit size, type, and property location
* Comparable units from the same property

### Lease Clause Generator

On the Lease Agreement form, click **Generate Clauses (AI)**. The AI drafts 10 standard clause categories:
* Payment terms, maintenance obligations, permitted use
* Subletting restrictions, alterations policy, entry rights
* Termination notice, renewal rights, dispute resolution, governing law

Clauses are saved to the AI Clauses field and included in the Lease Agreement print format.

### Predictive Maintenance

Every week the scheduler analyses units with at least 3 completed maintenance records. For each unit it predicts:
* Likely failure category
* Suggested inspection/service date
* Priority level and reasoning

A draft Maintenance Request is created for each prediction so a manager can review and schedule proactively.

### Natural Language Portfolio Analytics

The Portfolio Dashboard has an AI chat widget. Type any question about your portfolio in plain English:

> "How many units are currently vacant and what is the estimated monthly revenue loss?"
> "Which properties have the most overdue invoices this quarter?"
> "List tenants whose leases expire in the next 60 days."

The AI builds live context from your database (occupancy, rent collection, expiring leases, maintenance stats) before answering.

### Owner Statement Narrative

When an Owner Statement is submitted, the AI automatically writes a 2-paragraph narrative summarising the month's performance for that property, including occupancy highlights, income versus maintenance costs, and notable events.

---

## Tenant Portal

The tenant portal is a web page available at `yoursite.com/tenant-portal` for any logged-in user whose email matches a Customer marked as a tenant.

**What tenants can do:**
* View all active and past leases with key terms
* Download any rent invoice as a PDF
* See their outstanding balance
* Submit new maintenance requests with descriptions and photo attachments
* Track the status of existing maintenance requests

**Authentication**: Tenants log in using Frappe's standard login page. Guest users are redirected to login automatically. No Frappe desk access is given to the Tenant role.

---

## Portfolio Dashboard
